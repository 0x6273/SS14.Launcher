# SS14 Launcher

This launcher launches automatically downloads the latest version of SS14 and runs it.

Right now it's a really bare bones .NET Core console app.
Ideally it'd do a lot more in the future (like allowing you to start the server) and be a GUI app.
For now though it's a massive improvement over manually downloading and extracting client zip files from Jenkins.

Check the releases section for a binary download.
